# Lazy Release Persistency (LRP).

LRP is integrated to the PriME simulator.  PriME is an execution-driven x86 simulator for manycore architectures. It is capable of simulating 1000+ cores with rich cache hierarchies, coherence protocols and On-chip Network. It is capable of running both multi-threaded and multi-programmed workloads. Moreover, it can distribute multi-programmed workloads into multiple host machines and communicate via OpenMPI.

More details about PriME can be found in our ISPASS 2014 paper: Yaosheng Fu, David Wentzlaff, "PriME: A parallel and distributed simulator for thousand-core chips", IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS), March 2014.

Directory structure
-------------------

* bin: executable binary files 
* cmd: bash command files generated by run_prime
* dep: dependency files generated during compilation
* obj: object files generated during compilation
* output: default location for simulation report files
* src: source code files
* tools: python scripts to config and run PriME
* xml: default location for configuration xml files generated by config_prime

* asplos: scripts and files for asplos artifacts.
* pbench: benchmarks based on the synchrobench.
* ppin: pin tests


Requirements for LRP
--------------------

* gcc v4.8 or higher is recommended 
* Intel Pin tested under v2.14 71313
* OpenMPI tested under v3.0.0  (need to support MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE which can be done by adding --enable-mpi-thread-multiple option during installation. If you already have OPEN MPI you can chek this by running "ompi_info | grep -i thread" command)
* libxml2 tested under v2.9.1

Download LRP
------------
* cd primesim (Go to the primesim directory)
* make sure that your are in the dimp branch

How to compile
--------------
* cd primesim (Go to the primesim directory)
* Modify env.sh to set those environment variables to be the correct paths. And then run follwoing
* source env.sh.
* make -B


How to compile benchmarks
-------------------------
* cd pbench/syncbench
* make -B
* cd ../.. (come back to the primesim path) 


Simple Test for MPI
--------------------
mpiexec --verbose --display-map --display-allocation -mca btl_sm_use_knem 0 -np 1 ls



Possible Issues/Errors
--------------------------
* libxml2 file path not found. Plase check if your libxml2 path in the env.sh is right ()
* libmpi.so path not found. Please check OPENMPI_LIB_PATH in env.sh and check if the path is in the right path.
* please check the MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE flag. Most of the time it is not set by default. In case, you have to reinstall MPI with the flag set (--enable-mpi-thread-multiple).
* Run ompi_info | grep -i thread. It should say yes. (Thread support: posix (MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE: yes, OPAL support: yes, OMPI progress: no, ORTE progress: yes, Event lib: yes))
