Experimental ssetup

#8th is the new starting point

#8 fixed the peristent queue and extend it to lfqueue
#9 -> change the parity to 8B
#10 - change the parity to 32B


find the topology is incorrect
right 32K private L1 and 1MB per slice shared LLC/L2

#11 should be : fixed the topology and run 4B in all nbenchmarks, which i have never done before.

Shared-llc represent the banked llc with only last level cache. netwrok=1 hop, shared-llc acess time=10cycles.


#10 is 32B load
both regular, balanced and now shared-lls setup
#10 does not include linkedlist
